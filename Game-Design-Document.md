# Space Depths: Game Design Document

## Core Concept

A React-based infinite dungeon crawler set in the vastness of space where players navigate procedurally generated derelict space stations, abandoned ships, and mysterious cosmic anomalies. As players delve deeper, they discover better equipment, develop unique skills, and face increasingly challenging enemies.

## Core Loop Mechanics

### The Expedition Loop

1. **Prepare** - Equip gear, allocate skill points, select consumables
2. **Explore** - Navigate through rooms/sectors of the current space structure
3. **Encounter** - Combat, puzzles, treasure, or environmental hazards
4. **Decision** - Continue deeper or extract with current gains
5. **Reward** - Gain resources, equipment, and experience
6. **Upgrade** - Improve character with new equipment and skills
7. **Repeat** - Begin a new expedition into newly generated content

### Infinite Progression System

- **Depth Levels**: Each "floor" increases in difficulty but offers better rewards
- **Oxygen System**: Limited oxygen creates natural time pressure (can be upgraded)
- **Extraction Points**: Strategic decision points to leave with gathered resources or risk continuing
- **Permanent Upgrades**: Meta-progression between runs
- **Scrap Matter**: Universal currency earned during expeditions that persists after death

## Combat Mechanics

### Core Combat

- **Resource-based**: Manage energy, ammunition, and oxygen during encounters
- **Position-based**: Strategic movement and positioning for combat advantage
- **Cooldown Management**: Balance using abilities at optimal times

### Enemy Design Philosophy

- **Behavioral Patterns**: Each enemy has recognizable attack patterns to learn
- **Environmental Interaction**: Enemies utilize the environment in unique ways
- **Weakness Systems**: Specific damage types or tactics are more effective
- **Escalating Challenges**: New enemy types introduced as player progresses deeper

### Special Combat Mechanics

- **Vacuum Exposure**: Damaged sections may lose atmosphere, affecting combat
- **Zero-G Encounters**: Some areas have no gravity, changing movement mechanics
- **Radiation Zones**: Areas that damage players over time unless protected
- **Dimensional Rifts**: Temporary portals that can be used tactically

## Exploration System

### Procedural Generation

- **Room Templates**: Pre-designed room layouts combined procedurally
- **Environmental Hazards**: Radiation, vacuum exposure, gravity fluctuations
- **Secret Areas**: Hidden rooms with special rewards for thorough explorers
- **Biome Variations**: Different space structure types (military vessels, research stations, alien constructs)

### Discovery Mechanics

- **Scanner System**: Reveal information about surroundings and enemies
- **Research Database**: Collect information about encountered entities
- **Artifact Collection**: Discover unique items that provide lore and benefits
- **Blueprint System**: Find schematics to craft equipment between expeditions

## Progression & Feedback Systems

### Short-term Feedback

- **Visual/Audio Feedback**: Satisfying effects for kills, critical hits, discoveries
- **Combat Momentum**: Chain successful actions for increased effectiveness
- **Room Clearing Rewards**: Immediate rewards upon clearing encounters
- **Micro-objectives**: Small goals that update frequently during play

### Medium-term Goals

- **Floor Boss Encounters**: Major enemies guarding progress to deeper levels
